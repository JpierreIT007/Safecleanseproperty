SAFE CLEANSE PROPERTY LLC — Static Website Package
Files included:
- index.html
- services.html
- about.html
- contact.html
- styles.css

What this is:
- A fully static, responsive website ready to host on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
- No monthly hosting fees required. You will only pay for the domain (if you want a .com) — ~ $10/year.

Deployment options:

1) GitHub Pages (Free)
- Create a GitHub repository (public or private).
- Upload these files to the repository's root (or the 'gh-pages' branch).
- In repository settings -> Pages -> set source to main branch root (or gh-pages).
- Your site will be live at: https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<repo-name>  (or at a custom domain if you configure one)

2) Netlify (Free)
- Create a Netlify account.
- Drag & drop the zip or the site folder into Netlify's Sites -> New site from Git -> deploy.
- Connect your custom domain in Site settings -> Domain management.

3) Vercel / Cloudflare Pages: similar to Netlify.

Contact form note:
- The included form uses mailto: which opens the user's email app.
- If you want a hosted form (submissions stored), use a form backend:
  - Formspree (has a free tier)
  - Netlify Forms (if hosted on Netlify)
  - Google Forms (embed)

Custom domain:
- Buy a domain from Namecheap / GoDaddy (~$10/year).
- Follow host provider instructions to point the domain (DNS A/CNAME records).
- If using Netlify/GitHub Pages, they provide guides for linking a custom domain.

Need help?
- I can: customize text, add photos, generate images, or create step-by-step deployment with screenshots.
- Tell me if you want the site packaged differently or need a simple logo.
